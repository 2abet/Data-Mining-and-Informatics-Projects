      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had high expectations based on the positive reviews but was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>The story had a good potential to explore a relationship between a sophisticated black pianist who employs a white working class driver as they travel through the US south in the sixties. They have seemingly nothing in common, from the way they were brought up, the way they speak and eat, their family backgrounds and financial situations, their way of treating other people. As they spend time together on the road trip, they start to appreciate each other and learn from each other.<br/><br/>What bothered me was that the characters ended up being caricatures instead of being believable. The film tries to depict their differences to the point that it did not make sense. For example, we are supposed to believe that a black musical genius pianist never heard of Aretha Franklin or Little Richard? Or that he never tried fried chicken? I also thought that Viggo Mortensen was slightly over-acting.... The racial problems were not depicted in an authentic way.<br/><br/>The movie just received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, likely because of the social commentary and not because of great film-making.</div>\n",

This is low grade pap, unchallenging, unbeleivable, dull and so cliched its difficult to believe a fine actor like Mortensen would get involved. And why cast a Scandinavian as a Bronx Italian? Mahershala Ali has done himself no favours either creating a cartoonish 'sophisticate', though the hand doubling during his piano playing was impressive. This is heavy handed populism, shallow and self-righteously preaching, reducing a complex social struggle to simple stereotypes. The cinema landscape of 2018 must be very lacking for this to be lauded as it is. But then in reality it is not, with Masterpieces like Roma on display, its just that the Oscars is not really as important as it would like to be.</div>\n",

Not only that, but the whole movie was like a bad TV movie. And that description no longer holds up because it's Television (specifically cable television) where all the truly great storytelling takes place now. The writing in this film was trite at best, and overly dramatic at worst. This is the second movie starring Viggo I couldn't stand. The other film was, The History Of Violence.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The reviews are so telling. People watch this film as an excuse to perpetually ignore their own racist bias. White people and their self-absorbed white savior fantasies such as \"Green Book\" are the reason why black people of color feel so misrepresented in film and tv.<br/><br/>Not only is the film highly offensive in the way Mr. Shirley is being guided by Mortensen's character, and how he dictates him how to find his roots to his culture back, which is just so wrong on so many levels, but it also makes the racist a literal hero, who is excused in such a rushed and inelegant fashion.<br/><br/>He teaches Shirley how to eat chicken wings in what comes across as one of the most misguided and stereotypical colonial views of cultural identity. Of course the old white boomers in this world laugh their ass off when it comes to such badly written trite garbage, because it reinforces their black and white views.<br/><br/>Its such a caricatural portrayal of a very one sided story, fabricated by three white writers (!) who didn't even ask Shirleys family for permission and creative direction. As such, the film can barely be considered progressive, faithful or even emotionally intelligent. Its as if three white-frat-dude-bros gave a presentation on how to fight racism. This aint it guys.<br/><br/>Green Book is hilariously inadequate oscar bait made for the masses, a film that will go down as one of the most horrendous oscar winners and remind people in the future how award shows were dominated by ignorant white voters who didn't bother looking up the terms \"white savior narrative\", or who simply didn't care.<br/><br/>I hope people on IMDb reach out of their cultural bubble and confront these films in a more critical manner, and not just watch films superficially while being fed with problematic narratives. The previous winner \"Moonlight\" made by an actual black director has a lower score than this, and it basically says everything we need to know about racial insensitivity on here.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just.....no.<br/><br/>\"Green Book\" is the kind of movie my mom likes, and trust me, that's not a compliment. It's for people who are willing to watch a movie about racism as long as the black character who's the victim of it is whiter than any of the white characters. It's for people who want to pat themselves on the back for being open to a \"serious\" movie that doesn't challenge a single belief or make them the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's for people who like music cues that tell them exactly what they're supposed to be feeling at every single moment. It's for people who think the answer to racial problems is for whites and blacks to compromise and find some middle ground where they can agree to overcome their differences, as if black people have any responsibility in the fact that they have been marginalized ever since the very first one set foot on American soil. No one who is the slightest bit tuned in to racial problems in contemporary America could possibly stomach this movie.<br/><br/>Personally, I found it to be patronizing and damn near insulting. It consists of scene after scene of our black protagonist getting himself in trouble, only to be saved from the situation by the white guy. By the end, the white guy has taught him how to be more black and embrace his own culture, which in this movie is defined by liking fried chicken, listening to Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, and playing some funky piano. Oh but wait, defenders will say. The white guy learns something too, like how to be less racist and how to write really good love letters to his wife. In fact, the entire guys' racist family learns to not be racist by the end and welcomes the black guy to their Christmas dinner. They're just casually racist, you see, but not racist in ways that really matter. Barf.<br/><br/>Seriously, this is the Sesame Street version of racism. In a year that gave us \"BlackkKlansman,\" \"Blindspotting,\" \"The Hate U Give,\" and \"Sorry to Bother You,\" all movies made by minorities about the black experience in America, it's pretty telling of where we are as culture right now that the race movie mainstream America glommed on to was this piece of feel-good hoo-hah. Mainstream America doesn't want to have its beliefs challenged, and it certainly doesn't want to be told it's part of the problem. Instead, it wants a hallmark movie that makes it feel good about itself.<br/><br/>One thing saves \"Green Book\" from being an utter waste of time, and that is the performance of Viggo Mortensen.<br/><br/>Grade: D</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardinelli, Joe Cortese, Dimiter D. Marinov, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tom Virtue, Brian Stepanek, Iqbal Theba, P.J. Byrne, Maggie Nixon. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (Mortensen), loving husband and father, wise-guy-adjacent tough guy, and casual racist, is selected to drive acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) on an eight-week road trip through the Deep South; no need for the audience to bring the rose-colored shades since all cameras used to shoot this picture apparently had that filter on preset. Old-fashioned to the point of insult, the majority of the running time is spent in the company of both men, who \"learn\" from each other and \"bond\" as a result (at least they both know how to eat fried chicken by the end), although their camaraderie rarely exceeds the level of a second-rate buddy movie. It's a trial to watch good actors like Mortensen and Ali try to breathe life into one of the hokiest and most obvious screenplays for a major motion picture in several years; granted, it doesn't help that Mortensen chooses to play it too broad (the crass Italian-American stereotyping feels pulled less from reality than from sketch comedy). Ali fares a little better, but his tightly-wound but injured stoicism does not profit from the producers' decision to rarely let Shirley be onscreen without Vallelonga, depriving us of critical reactions and emotions that aren't surface-deep and observed through another character's eyes. (There's even a brief episode where it's revealed that Shirley is gay, but Vallelonga barely seems interested and the movie never brings it up again.) Focusing almost entirely on the white character wouldn't have been so problematic if Vallelonga actually showed growth and regret and changed for the better, but he's pretty much the same person he was at the beginning, just willing to accept this specific black man as slightly-more-friend-than-employer. Designed and packaged as crowd-pleasing fare, and the con seemed to work when it nabbed a Best Picture Oscar, but this is little more than a clumsy reversal of \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" another inexplicable populist victor that feels a little embarrassing in retrospect.<br/><br/>32/100</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This has to be one of the most driest, stalest scripts I have ever seen put on screen. Saying that this film is underwhelming is an understatement. The story is incredibly dull, and redundant, the acting was really pale, The filmmaking aspects were nonexistent and/or unspecial. All of these elements combing to make the most dullest, watered down films of the 2010s let alone 2018. The fact this won best picture was astounding, but this being an incredibly boring, insignificant film about racism its not too surprising the academy would pick this as the most \"important film of 2018\".<br/><br/>I doubt this film will ever be talked about again other than \"what not to do with your script\". I know This review itself is probably insignificant but, really I'm appalled and impressed by the relentless bore this film brings on. I just needed to get my thoughts out before I start burning buildings, and worshipping Satan.<br/><br/>2/10</div>\n",

It has the slick and polished production, but that can't overcome the steady stream of nonsense this movie dribbles forth. Sadly, these are the types of movies Viggo always seems to stumble upon, and honestly I don't think he possesses the talent to tackle anything of real substance. This movie had very strong subject matter but the handling and production was 2nd rate at best. The best thing here is the music and the cars of that era. Skip it. There's way better movies on racial tensions out there that aren't a laughable mess. Mississippi Burning. A Time To Kill. Avoid this stinker.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Hey Ram is the story of Saket Ram (Kamal Haasan), an archaeologist. He is on a dig in pre-partition Harappa with his buddy Amjad (Shah Rukh Khan) when communal violence erupts in the region and the dig is closed down. Saket Ram goes off to Calcutta to visit his new wife Aparna (Rani Mukherjee). Calcutta is in chaos with religious strife and Ram's wife is brutally assaulted and killed by some Muslim men a few days after his return. He becomes unstable and seeks out the perpetrators of the crime and deals with them. While wandering the streets Ram meets with Abhyankar (Atul Kulkarni) who tells him that his family has suffered a similar fate and that the one man responsible for all this is MK Gandhi. Ram goes off to Tamil Nadu and after seeing Maithili (Vasundhara Das) agrees to marry her. All the time he is still traumatized by Aparna's death and planning revenge. When Abhyankar is paralyzed in a polo accident Ram vows to take his place as the killer of the Mahatma. He moves to Delhi and there he re-encounters his friend Amjad. Now hatred for Muslims and his prior closeness to Amjad are at war and Ram must choose his path - will it be the road to revenge or redemption? The story is excellent and the movie manages to retain its grip on the viewer for over three hours. The direction is for the most part very good. There are a few strange moments that seemed unnecessary to me - why is there the surreal stuff when Ram is shown with Maithili? The Marathi dance seemed unnecessary. Why were the bullets in a cartridge in a pre-partition handgun? Can one talk after one's throat is sliced open? But these are indeed minor quibbles in an overall excellent film.<br/><br/>The background score is a bit intrusive, the songs not memorable. Maybe this is not the best of the Maestro Illayaraja. The beginning song/dance in the club is sort of silly, certainly not needed. Surely bonding between friends can be shown in other ways.<br/><br/>Acting is very good throughout. For me the outstanding performance was given by Rani Mukherjee. She breathed life into Aparna and was at her most attractive and charming as a Bengali Bodhu! Kamal was very good. He showed love, passion, anger, rage, madness very well. And what looks at nearly age 50! The man is awesome. Shah Rukh gave a great performance as Amjad - a very restrained and balanced performance that in the end showed us which path Ram would choose and why. Atul Kulkarni was awesome as the fanatical Abhyanker. Vasundhara Das was luminous and did an excellent job playing Maithili. Naseer Shah as Gandhi, Hema Malini as the mother were all very good. In fact there was no bad performance in the film.<br/><br/>This is a fine piece of movie making and deserves all the accolades it got. If you have not yet seen this film then you are in for a rare treat.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A Real Eye-Opener... and that's what its is. First of all I would like to inform that I haven't yet watched the original version of this movie which claims to be better than this Hindi version.That's the reason I can't compare both movies. This movie has it all,whether its Hard-Core Reality, maturity, direction, special-effects and most of all great acting and true-to-the-core screenplay which provides us with nothing but tough reality which can be bargained for nothing, NOT even for what everybody calls, Religious Tolerance. However one tries to ignore it,one cannot defy the hard truthfulness of the subject of this movie. As far as the plot is concerned it's imaginary but not impossible. The idea that there could have been more than one potential killers of Gandhiji is not impossible.But that is not what the talented Kamal Haasan want to present in front of us.Instead he wants to introduce the ACTUAL circumstances during the times of Indian struggle for freedom. he has truly depicted the life of an average Indian who truly loves his motherland and beautifully depicted the transformations he undergoes from an anti-Muslim, anti-Gandhi to a humanataranian. My personal favourite from the movie though is not Kamal's character but that of Atul Kulkarni's.The way he lives his life as tough as that,his inteligence,his intense love for his motherland which overrides his mind even in the eventuality of facing a physical disorder which he has to suffer and also as a result of which he get bedridden is truly inspirational.And most of all it was TRUE in those days! The visual-effects though not the greatest but are great. This script is what we can call a revolution in (1)typical Indian's thinking standards,(2)expression of hard-core reality. Also as a movie its simply great for its acting,visual effects, direction and most of all its Script. Truly, this movie enjoyed the well deserved nomination from India's part in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards.And it well could have been the winner if only it could have been possible for Kamal Haasan to put much more necessary efforts in that direction. Finally,though not a completely perfect movie still I would give it a 10 out of 10 due to its TRUTHFULNESS. If the Always Talented Kamal Haasan makes a next movie even half good as this one I would like to watch it. Its unarguably the best of all Indian movies including Hindi ones.<br/><br/>It's my personal Rank One among my top ten Indian (though not international)movies. The future would be great if more individuals would watch more mature movies like this. Also this is my first review of its kind so if possible forgive me for any misgivings.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">What an emotional and eye opening journey regarding the dangerous mix of religion and politics. The same dangerous mix we still face today. How can we profess to be products of a creator when we malign and even kill each other for the sake of an interpretation of our creator's being, the love that must have been to create us in the first place. I have just watched the DVD and cannot quite crying for the waste of good lives - the same waste occurring today. Will we ever learn?! Just a note on Shahrukh Khan's role and performance in the film...it was very understated and very moving. Since he his a Muslim, wouldn't it be nice to see him more roles expressing his own beliefs? It's amazing what influence a popular celebrity can have on popular thought. During such a time of religious warfare, it would be nice to see more films such as this that leave one with the conclusion the religious wars are an abomination. That there really is no such thing as a righteous war. Killing in the same of our creator is much the same as killing our siblings in the name of our parents. Can you imagine them condoning such behavior? Not I.<br/><br/>This was an excellent film on several levels including artistry, story line, and acting and direction. For what ever reason one would want to view films, except for simple mindless escapism, this is one to view and digest.</div>\n",

Coming to the acting, I personally feel this is one of the best movies of almost every actor in the movie..Kamal is his usual splendid self....Watch him become the happy lover, the broken human being, the idealist and finally the old man with wrinkles of experience...the idea of having used colour in the past and b/w in the present is definitely a great concept.....Other than Kamal Haasan, Atul Kulkarni and Rani Mukherjee have given mind-blowing performances....Kulkarni is an incredibly talented actor and one can see the emotion in his eyes that speak most of his dialogues in the movie...Rani mukherjee is the perfect fit for her role of a Bengali teacher and has given a wonderful performance......The movie comes as a kind of rebel in the usual masala Indian movies genre and is a must watch for anyone interested in gaining a wholesome experience....Another feather on India cinema's cap.....</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Gandhiji is said to be the father of the India. A Mahathma who lived his principles instead of just preaching. But why on earth someone would want to kill him? It is something that the politicians and religious fellows wanted to hide from the general public. Kamal Hassan takes a brave step in putting things on the screen for everyone to see. True that the film evoked anger at many sects, but none could stop the film as everything is history and hence cannot be denied. The film supports religious harmony and breaks a lot of myths (including the one that Gandhi said 'hey ram' after being shot). Every Indian should see the film (where he is a Hindu or a Muslim doesn't matter at all). For that India would live in peace.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is an idolized figure in India.  He is one who is almost raised to the status of GOD by many.  Films such as Richard Attenborough's \"Gandhi\" have glorified this figure repeatedly and rightfully so.  However, this is only one side of the story.  What Kamal Haasan shows through \"Hey! Ram\" is that Gandhi is a part of history and history cannot be changed and needs to be told as it was.  Gandhi was not the \"glory\" that he is believed to be for everyone!  There were numerous people who opposed him and his policies.  Contrary to much of the controversy behind this film, \"Hey! Ram\" does not trivialize Gandhi, nor does it blame him.  In fact, the main character, Saket Ram (Kamal Haasan in a powerhouse performance)learns to appreciate Gandhi by the end of the journey.  The point of the film is not that he does learn to appreciate Gandhi despite being chosen as his potential assassin, but rather the way he makes his journey to that point. This journey is so masterfully and artistically directed by Kamal Haasan that one cannot help but sit back and be stunned at what this genius is capable of.  What Haasan has created with \"Hey! Ram\" is not only an epic film but perhaps the biggest casting coup of the decade with actors like Nasseeruddin Shah (who makes a better Gandhi than Ben Kingsley), Om Puri, Shahrukh Khan, Rani Mukherji, Girish Karnad and many other prominent names of the Indian Film Industry.  The cinematography is simply brilliant and Renu Saluja's editing is a work of art.  Ilayaraja's music is a highly emotive score that effectively blends western orchestral arrangements with traditional carnatic sounds.  \"Hey! Ram\" is one of the greatest Indian films ever made.  It takes a lot of intelligence and passion to make and appreciate a film like \"Hey! Ram.\"</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Kamal Hasan is a truly great actor and with this film he has cemented his status a talented director. This is an epic film which is extremely thoughtful. It shows how a rationale man can turn into a prujudiced extremist. It shows that hatred for past tragic events will not solve feelings of loss of a loved one. It also shows that compassion and sacrifice are needed in politics rather that populist rabble rousing. This film has been criticized in many quarters for many reasons. People have said that the film focuses on Kamal Hasan too much and that it a self indugent vanity fest. This is unfair considering Mr Kamalji is one of the best actors in India. Also the film is about this person and the imapct on his thinking to tragic surrounding events. The film would not have worked without this intense focus. The film's storyline has been labeled inconsistent. It has been cited that the change to a anti-Islamic Hindu fundamenatlist in Kamal Hasan's character was not explained. If a muslim (who was a loyal servant and friend) had murdered your wife I think most people attitudes to your fellow man would change. The film has a consistent plot. The only critisicm is that perhaps the film was too long but overall a great film which is indeed an experiment with truth.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Before I discuss the film in depth, I want to talk about the distributor of this DVD--Eros Video. Despite the name, it is not a pornographic film company. But, I am less than impressed by their practice of forcing ads upon the viewer. When the DVD begins, it forces you to watch previews (you cannot hit the menu button to skip them). Then, AFTER you finally push the DVD button to begin the feature, it forces you to watch another ad! This is the only company I know which does this. They also do something else which is terribly annoying--they don't bother to caption the songs sung throughout the film! Come on Eros, are you deliberately trying to get potential customers to deliberately avoid your releases and look for other Indian films to watch instead?! I know that because there are thousands and thousands of Indian films out there, I sure will look for those from other companies first.<br/><br/>The story is told as a giant flashback by Saketh Ram (Kamal Hassan) and is set in 1946--just a year before India became independent of the United Kingdom. While many in the West may not realize it, this was a VERY scary time in India, as partition into East and West Pakistan and India would help to bring a lot of suppressed hatred between Hindus and Muslims to the surface--and countless people (at least in the hundreds of thousands) would die in sectarian violence. Many more would be forced to immigrate because of this violence.<br/><br/>Ram adores his new wife--so much so that his friends think he's a bit henpecked and make fun of him. When, in the midst of the violence that is overtaking his city, he sees a woman being attacked by a crowd he rescues her--but, as the expression goes, no good deed goes unpunished! Later, a crowd of Muslims storms his home--raping and murdering his wife! Not surprisingly, he now hates Muslims and joins a group of extremists--determined to kill as many of 'them' as he possibly can. However, he and his new 'friends' come to hate one person more than anyone else...Gandhi. Although a Hindu, Gandhi calls for peace and forgiveness--which enrages these radicals and he is their number one target....and Ram is their chosen instrument of revenge.<br/><br/>You probably noticed my summary in which I called this a fine but brutal film. Now the brutality certainly is necessary--this film is about a very, very violent time in India and I think everyone should know more about this period in history. But it is NOT a film for the young. While it doesn't show the rape occurring (thank God), it has quite a few scenes of shocking brutality. You can't help but flinch at several scenes--I know I did. Plus, this DID make the movie more realistic and hard-hitting---so have some Kleenex nearby just in case. And what is to like about the movie? Well, a lot...that's for sure. To me one of the best things about the film was choosing Kamal Hassan for the lead. He not only did a good job but looked so ordinary--not the larger than life sexy leading man. This 'ordinariness' of Ram and his wife as well made the film much easier to connect with and appreciate. I also liked the story....with one minor exception. Although the film is told through flashbacks, sometimes you can't tell when it's in the 1940s or the present--and that is a tad confusing--as are some of the surreal dreams. But, these are minor complaints, as the overall film is entertaining, touching and informative.<br/><br/>For another film about the same period, though told from a different viewpoint, try also watching Deepa Metha's \"Fire\". I don't think the film is superior to \"Hey Ram\"--just different and quite touching.</div>\n",

A reality show,fully mature and a search for the truth.its a great story telling with even greater acting by all its characters. it may some time make you think that path of gandhiji was not right,but eventually just like the hero knees down you would think that whatever Mr. Gandhi had in his hand he did his best. thanks to Mr. kamal haasan for his i think best Hindi movie and one of my best one too.. and finally i got it worthy enough to give it 9.9 out of 10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is a kind of movie where you will find a new details every time you watch it.<br/><br/>The plot is set around the events in the time period between Direct Action Day (16 Aug, 1946) to Gandhi's assassination (Jan 30, 1948). This is definitely a wonderful watch if you know background of characters like Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Godse and Direct Action Day. The story proclaims itself as a combination of Fact + Fiction when the movie starts in the house of a bedridden old Saket Ram. And, except Gandhi, Suhrawardy, Godse other real characters from the Partition era are given least importance as the plot is about how the fictional characters, their family and friendship is affected because of this partition decision and the ensuing riots.<br/><br/>There is also a small bit of alternate history, where Saket Ram hallucinates his wife saying - \"This is Vijaya Dasami Day... You are chosen to accomplish the mission..\" while in reality it was Muslim League who said \"Muslims must remember that ... it was in Ramazan that the permission for jehad was granted by Allah...\" and provocated the Direct Action Day riots.<br/><br/>And, this is one of the boldest attempts in portraying Gandhi, where two sides of the character are presented. There are some who praise Gandhi and there are some who criticize Gandhi for his actions. And, this happens right from the starting till the last part. I think no other film has taken such a dual stand on Gandhi.<br/><br/>This is one of the rarest and finest work of Indian cinema that everyone should watch to know what Indian cinema can produce!!</div>\n",

You wont find it interesting if you are used to the regular kind of movies.<br/><br/>Kamal Haasan has worked hard in selecting the crew. Each important character that appears in the movie, speaks his/her own language, in their native accent. Example, Rani appears as a Bengali, Shahrukh Khan as a proper 'Khan'.<br/><br/>One small trouble with this movie is the number of languages used - which perhaps results in a slight lack of integrity.<br/><br/>Musical score by Ilayaraja is excellent.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">An excellently crafted Indian film, the lead actor Kamal Hassan amazes me not only with his histrionics as the lead actor but also as a good writer and director. Technically brilliant, the story has many layers to it. I liked the idea of showing the story in the eyes of a dying old man (good use of prosthetic make-up on Hassan) for whom the past is vivid in memory and the present is bleak. So, the story of the past is in color and the present in Black and White... a novel approach indeed.<br/><br/>It's a look at a fictitious character who could have been Gandhi's assassin. It's a look at the counter-effect of Gandhi's principles and his decisions (or the lack thereof) on the lives of some of the Hindus. It brings to light something Indian history books were embarrassed to talk about!<br/><br/>The story itself covers 50 decades and has characters from every region of India, the hero is a Tamil Brahmin, his first wife a Bengali, his best friend a Muslim pathan, his 'guide', a Maharashtrian, and his target, a Gujarati! Rani Mukharjee and Shah Rukh excel in their small but substantial roles. Atul Kulkarni as Abhyankar and singer Vasundhara Das stand out in their debut performances.<br/><br/>The highlight of the film of course is its background music by Maestro Ilaya Raja. I believe he is the only Asian to have composed a symphony, that too in 30 days flat!!!! There's no composer in India who can match up to this guy. Alas, the Hindi film industry these days encourages only mediocrity and has not recognized this gem from the South! I wish the movie's background music score is made available. Of the songs, there's one which kind of remained in the background for some reason, it is an excellent melody.. 'Har Koyee Samjhe' sung by classical artist, Ajoy Chakraborti.<br/><br/>Cinematography and art-direction too are flawless. All in all a great film. If you are tired of watching candy-floss romances, inane comedies, garish family dramas and weddings... this is THE antidote! Go for it!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had already said what I had to about this particular movie long ago in the previous version of my review of mine.<br/><br/>Here I am going to clarify on a few aspects about this movie which some of the so called critics have put forward :<br/><br/>1. Critic No.1 argues: What has Kamal Haasan shown so different in this movie ? This critic says, Kamal has shown Muslims at first, offending Hindus of all castes and types including the Sikhs,the South Indians,the Maharastrians and others AND this particular Hindu gets into the 5th gear, does an act of revenge and then blames this poor guy Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. According to the critic,Kamal instead could have shown the other way round.<br/><br/>My reply, as a representative of those millions of fans of 'Hey Ram(2000)':<br/><br/>\n",
      "I would recommend this Critic No.1 to watch movies like \"The Legend Of Bhagat Singh(2002)\", \"Veer Savarkar(2001)\", \"1947: Earth(1997)\". In the \"The Legend...\"  the great Bhagat Singh has a foresight that this Congress is gonna do nothing. The only aim of Congress is to acquire power and then the sentiments of Indian public go to Hell. Now this Congress which believes in so called Equality of Religions in India always looked upon Muslims as nothing but a Vote Bank. M. K. Gandhi was no doubt genuinely interested in the welfare of people but politically protected the Muslims and deliberately overlooked the behaviour of his so called  Muslim Brethren. Due to this political immunity the probability that in the freedom riots, the ratio of Muslims offenders to other non-Muslim offenders was 8 : 2 will be the most possible probability and nothing less than that.   In \"Veer Savarkar(2001)\" the great revolutionary Savarkar explains how this Khilafat movement is nothing but a joke, a farce. <br/><br/>In fact, the Britishers knew that revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Veer Savarkar were the REAL danger compared to the moderate M.K. Gandhi. That was the reason why British tortured them like they were in hell ,like they were some pigs in a slaughterhouse. Meanwhile the sweet spotlight was on Mr. M. K. Gandhi and his fasts.<br/><br/>Deepa  Mehta's masterpiece \"1947:Earth\"  reveals the attitude of the minority. But the other Star of the movie was of course the ever-talented Aamir Khan revealing his pure acting brilliance.<br/><br/>Mr. Critic No.1 should pick any newspaper from any stall from any locality from any Country and he should  find major news on the lines of rivalry between  America-Iraq, India-Pakistan or Israel-Palastine, the Babri Masjid issue and other such news. You will notice that one of the rival pairs is always a Islamic MILITANT group.<br/><br/>This problems have been existing  since Mr. Mohammad Gajni, then Aurangzeb and Osama Bin Laden and Dawood Ibrahim today.<br/><br/>2. Now this particular Critic  No. 2  argues : This movie contains unnecessary sex.<br/><br/>My reply,as a representative of those millions of fans of 'Hey Ram(2000)':<br/><br/>\n",
      "Sex depicted in this movie is at least a lot better and REALISTIC than the UNrealistic rain-dancing of those idiot actors(???) and saree-clad actresses(???) in those nonsense '3 out of 5' star rated movies. Also let's not forget the running around trees in fully forced rain. Did somebody say Influenza ?<br/><br/>This movie is only made for adults no doubt,  but it is meant for ONLY MATURE THOUGHTFUL REASONABLE ADULTS.<br/><br/>Sex is a nature's creation necessary for propagation of life and a KISS in particular is a universal symbol for expressing Love among living creatures including all animals but definitely NOT flowers as some Indian directors show in their nonsense '3 out of 5' star rated movies something UNNATURAL like flowers kissing each other instead of the hero and the heroine. All these efforts are to please our 70 years old  censorship 'virtuous' members. The fact is :  We don't need 'virtuous'  censorship members but mature,scientific, understanding, reasonable thinkers. BUT one thing I admit : This movie is NOT meant for family viewing where teenagers or children of lesser age are present. Even some adults can be considered as children if they don't possess a proper scientific view while watching  movies like this. If sex and violent scenes are removed from this movie it will become a truly visual effects family movie with a message at the end,middle and the beginning.<br/><br/>In fact, I found a lot positive aspects in 'Hey Ram(2000)' :<br/><br/>1. The technique used to show blood oozing out of Rani's throat was brutal but was a technical achievement in an Indian movie. The ONLY other time I observed the feat being used was in the legendary Steven Spielberg's Classic Masterpiece 'Saving Private Ryan(1998)' starring the great Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>2. Visual Effects during the marital bliss(Saket Ram/Maithili) and during the TWISTER scene were visual pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>3. At the climax, Kamal shows a child representing all the riot affected children and their problems. It's a pity rioting demons don't spare even innocent children.<br/><br/>4.The so called Astrological expert is blown to smithereens by Saket Ram. If every Indian follows his ideal, those 'Ponga Pandits' will never cheat us of our money.<br/><br/>5.Even milk goes for a kick and a toss when Saket Ram explains how it was meant only for children and not adults. Then follows a truly hilarious joke by Maithili.<br/><br/>6. One more myth like millions of others which was prevalent in India was buried that M.k. Gandhi uttered the words 'Hey Ram' moments before death. If a bullet traveling at a speed of 800 miles/hour is shot at you at a POINT BLANK range, your eyes will simply pop out. And here, M.K. Gandhi was a 79 year old man and he was shot by not one but TWO in the chest. If your lungs are that open forget about uttering any words at all.<br/><br/>7. The only fault Kamal did was a technical one. He shouldn't have shown Gandhi flying backwards when hit by the bullets. FORENSIC STUDIES have positively proved that if a live body is hit by a bullet, the body will simply slump down to the ground.<br/><br/>Some Other Things : Vasundhara Das, Atul Kulkarni and Shahrukh have performed in an OUTSTANDING way in a life-time role. Shahrukh doesn't over act and this proves Kamal's Effective Direction.<br/><br/>And now for those who say that this movie is disturbing or controversial :<br/><br/>All great masterpieces right from 'The Godfather(1972)' to 'Schindler's List(1993)' and to the recent 'The Sixth Sense(1999)' and 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' all had been controversial but TRUTHFUL EYE OPENERS.<br/><br/>In fact, according to me, an individual should watch only TWO types of movies :<br/><br/>1.TRUTHFUL EYE OPENERS : These types expose real facts but violence and sex are not necessities to be depicted. Examples:Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram(2000), Denzel Washington's Cry Freedom(1987), Al Pacino's Godfather(1972/74)series or The Insider(1999), Robert De Niro's The King of Comedy(1983),Morgan Freeman's SE7EN(1995),The Usual Suspects(1995) etc.<br/><br/>2. PURELY FICTIONAL DREAMLAND FEEL-GOOD MOVIES : These type of movies relieve us of our daily stresses and tensions when watched for fun keeping our brains aside for a while. Example : Steven Spielberg's E.T. : The Extra Terrestrial(1982) or Hook(1991),Beauty and the Beast(1991),The Lion King(1994),Casper(1995), The Batman Movies etc.<br/><br/>As for the remaining run-of-the-mill type of movies which do NOT belong to any of the above TWO types,I call them DUMB movies made for the similar types of individuals.<br/><br/>Eg. The extremely torturous The Mummy(1999),MouseHunt,I Know What You Did Last Summer... etc<br/><br/>These movies are, as Saket Ram says, as SEMI-FICTIONAL as M.K.Gandhi's autobiography.<br/><br/>        ... and I don't prefer semi fiction.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of the few Hindi films to take head on issues related with India's partition and succeed. 'Hey Ram' features an impressive performance by Kamal Hasan. His role is complex and its hard to see how anyone else could have done better. There are lots of religious metaphors subtly woven into the script. Naseeruddin Shah is a memorable eccentric Gandhi. Shahrukh Khan has a small role but impresses. The film is very violent and some parts are quite difficult to watch, so beware. The period detail is effective. Ultimately, the film makes a strong plea for tolerance but does so without strident moralizing. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10</div>\n",

The movie is a tribute to the society. Very well pictured.<br/><br/>The movie is moving with slow pace through out. Though at times we get the feeling that its gonna pace up, but it still moves in slow pace which might have disappointed some viewers and hence the movie couldn't do well in box office!<br/><br/>I think the background music ram .. ram.. hey hey ram ram.. should have been played through out the movie which would have made this more thrilling!<br/><br/>Anyways this is a masterpiece! <br/><br/>Kamal,RaniMukherji, Shahrukh all done a good job!<br/><br/>Cijo Thomas</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Kamal Hassan, one of the most popular &amp; talented actors from South started his directorial debut with the funny &amp; entertaining 'Chachi 420' where Hassan mastered the role of an old woman with ease. After a rib- tickling endeavour, Kamal Hassan grabbed the reigns to direct a powerful film of a completely new genre, 'Hey Ram' a film which displayed the communal instability in India post Independence in 1947. The words breathed last by the great leader of our country, Mahatma Gandhi itself reveals the fact that the film is based on a semi-fictional plot involved in the assassination of Gandhi. <br/><br/>Gathering an ensemble cast from Bollywood, Hassan made it a point to make a very commercial approach to the film. The film starred Kamal Hassan as the protagonist while Bollywood actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukherjee, Hema Malini, Naseeruddin Shah &amp; Om Puri handled small but significant roles. <br/><br/>The film commences on 6th December 1999 which marked the 7th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition which invited communal riots between Hindus &amp; Muslims. On this date, in a dark dingy room lay 89-year old Saket Ram on his death bed with his grandson by his side. The film time- travels to the era of 1940's where Pakistan &amp; India where being partitioned and that was the reason why two best friends Saket Ram (Kamal) &amp; Amjad Ali Khan (Shah Rukh), who were archaeologists working for a British named Wheeler were told to stop their work &amp; return back to their respective homes. <br/><br/>Saket Ram returns back to Calcutta to his Bengali wife, Aparna (Rani) but tragedy follows after him as Aparna gets sexually assaulted &amp; killed by Muslim extremists in the locality. A distraught &amp; enraged Saket Ram meets Abhyankar, a revolutionary who convinces Ram that Mahatma Gandhi is solely responsible for this bloodbath. Succumbed to family pressure, Saket Ram marries a teenager Maithili (Vasundhara Das). The film displays some intimate scenes between Saket &amp; Maithili. The scenes are so detailed that you find yourself astonished as why Censor Board did not intervene with their snipping tool.<br/><br/>The film revolves entirely around Saket Ram's life as he collaborates with Abhyankar and Maharaja and offers to help them in the plot to assassinate Gandhi. Shah Rukh Khan as Amjad Ali Khan is entirely used as a commercial weapon by Kamal Hassan as inspite of having just 30 minutes in the film; SRK has successfully managed to uplift the standard of the film. He plays a Muslim Pathan who rescues Saket Ram who gets trapped in the communal riots in curfew-struck Muslim community in Delhi. <br/><br/>The film indeed deserved more of Shah Rukh Khan's exquisite display of acting skills as his inclusion in Hey Ram poster must have promised the viewers a parallel role alongside Kamal. The film has some really advanced &amp; subtle effects, the film although shot in 2000 makes you feel as if the film is shot in the early 60's. The 1999 India scenario is showcased in black &amp; white to distinguish it well with the cinematic representation of happenings in past. <br/><br/>Hey Ram is powerful as it deals efficiently with universal &amp; contemporary themes set in the post-Independence India. Thanks to Kamal's creative mind &amp; brilliance put into the film, film was chosen as India's official entry to Oscars to be considered as nomination in Best Foreign Film of the year. Hey Ram is story of fictional character whose life gets turned up-side down because of some real life incidents in 1940's that have changed the course of history. The film concludes admirably in a poignant manner<br/><br/>People having a fine taste for art films, Hey Ram will give you one of the best cinematic experiences of your life.</div>\n",

Any dumb person can appreciate how perfect the movie is.<br/><br/>The Story begins in the present, a very old man in his death bed and his grandson noticing his deteriorated condition of the day calls his Doctor friend and plans to make it to the hospital. The Day is May Day. Mid-way through the journey Saket Ram (Kamal) relives his life that appears before him in capsules. <br/><br/>The period action is splendid.People who really understood the film will agree that Gandhi is the real hero of the film. The fact that he comes roughly around 30 minutes is the greatness of Kamal's direction and way of story-telling!! He would have shot the present in black-n white and the past with Gandhi in Colour and as soon as Gandhi is assassinated, the picture turns Black-n-white again. Just to show that Gandhi gave us Light and it turns black-n-white after his death. Towards the end, Saket's Grandson gets the key of one of Saket's private rooms and he visits it with Gandhi's real GreatGrandson. The movie finishes with both of them opening the windows carved on an image of Gandhi again sharing the same thought tat Gandhi showed light. Again he would shown the fire both in 1940s and present in color depicting how when everything's changed Violence has remained forever and how we haven't learned our lessons fully.<br/><br/>Hats Off Kamal and Thanks for Giving Indians \"Hey Ram\", No one could've done even 10percent of this, so forget expecting anything closer!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">.....though I'm not a fan of the genre so I haven't seen many.  I usually have to find another room to hide in whenever my sister's or mother watch them.  One day I saw a scene from \"Hey Ram\" and was intrigued, so I decided that maybe I'll check it out.  After seeing \"Sholay\", supposedly one of the greatest Indian movies ever made (maybe if you haven't already seen all the Westerns it stole from), and wasn't sure I could bare another one for a while.  But I did, and I'm glad.  It was far from perfect, but as other's mentioned, it was consistently watchable (it holds three hours of interest well), and features some bravura set pieces. I enjoyed the fantasy/nightmare sequences quite a bit.  I think the first poster missed the point of the second sex scene.... it was meant to be more disturbing than sexy.... it occurs during the peak of Ram's decent into madness.  I doubt Kamal Hassan meant for a women morphing into a gun to be sexy!  Some of the fantasy stuff wasn't entirely successful, but I appreciated the experimentation. The main flaw with the film I thought, was the music.... and I'm not talking about the musical numbers, but the score, which was far too overbearing at times.  But over all the film is quite powerful... the acting is sensational all around. Anyway, this is definitely a must see for anyone who (like I once did) that Indian commercial films never attempt to become works of art.</div>\n",

THIS IS THE GREATNESS OF THIS MOVIE! even long, it kept me in my seat.  the emotions are true, and the songs are better than any Hindi/Tamil movies i've ever seen (except for TAAL).

But the whole idea of two strangers meeting in an unfamiliar place(or a train as in both situations) and then finding that connection, is quite similar in both situations. Not to forget, even the clothes they are wearing are same. The situations they get themselves into, the church,the beautiful locales and everything. It looked that simple to me, take a great idea, 'Bollywoodify' it and there you go, you have a blockbuster. Plagiarism needs to be looked into. I am looking for times in bollywood where they at least acknowledge the source of their Idea. Like they picked Dead Poets Society and made a Mohabbatein out of it.The Music is one of the highlights of the movie. Watch it if you are a SRK fanboy. If you want to watch a good love story watch \"Before Sunrise\" where the idea of DDLJ came from,according to me! If you want a movie that's just to watch, enjoy and forget watch DDLJ. It just doesn't stay with you like Before Sunrise.I may seem like a bit partial towards Before Sunrise but I am sure if you watch both the movies, you wouldn't agree more.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">All the threads of Tolkien's magnum opus come together in the most elegant of fashions in the final part of Peter Jackson's adaptation. Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.<br/><br/>\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.<br/><br/>The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.<br/><br/>Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.<br/><br/>A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own. Well deserving of all the high praise thrown at it, and then some...</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I admit it, I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.<br/><br/>Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.<br/><br/>The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.<br/><br/>All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Peter Jackson has done it.  He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?<br/><br/>Perfect.<br/><br/>I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where \"Two Towers\" ends, so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done \"right\".  And when it happened, it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.<br/><br/>The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no \"Rings\" movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.<br/><br/>As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple \"fantasy\" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.<br/><br/>I will miss looking forward to a new \"Rings\" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a \"Top 40\" soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.<br/><br/>Each film has earned a \"10\" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for \"Best Picture\" of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.<br/><br/>At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.<br/><br/>This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.<br/><br/>These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.<br/><br/>After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.<br/><br/>I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.<br/><br/>I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day -- exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed, The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.<br/><br/>Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's linear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again, because just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The Return of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as four-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears.<br/><br/>The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts, and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has shown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.<br/><br/>The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated, that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to the moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are the best of the best.<br/><br/>The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this film delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime, and many more years to come.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just as Peter Jackson felt that LOTR had to be made as one large, three-part, cinematic piece, I decided to write my IMDb review of all three movies as a single, multi-part essay. Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.<br/><br/>Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.<br/><br/>Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.<br/><br/>The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.<br/><br/>The casting and acting are superb.<br/><br/>The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.<br/><br/>Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.<br/><br/>Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.<br/><br/>Return of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I've seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn't done either.<br/><br/>The storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman's love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.<br/><br/>This is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner's Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn't been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)<br/><br/>The worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you'd notice . . .</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum.  Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.<br/><br/>If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film.  For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent.  Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well.  I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.<br/><br/>The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes.  There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end.  To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!)  This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.<br/><br/>The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent.  Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship.  Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension).  Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role.  I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things.  Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy.  His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny.  Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish.  He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way.  It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.<br/><br/>The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment.  Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game.  Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was!  This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film.  Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.<br/><br/>I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film.  It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Where to start with this masterpiece? Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. A fitting end to a stunning trilogy. The acting as it has been is brilliant again. Special mention must go to Sean Austin, for his performance as Sam. In this one he gets his big moment in the trilogy, and he nails it perfectly. His scenes with Elijah Wood (Frodo) on Mount Doom, as Frodo weakens are full of emotion and very powerful. As for the rest of the movie? It has one of the greatest scenes EVER in a movie : the riders of Rohan charging into battle outside Minas Tirith. You simply cannot tell where the real riders end, and the CGI begins. The battles again are well done, and not simply a repeat of the siege at Helms Deep in The Two Towers.<br/><br/>As I said, the acting is again first rate from the entire cast. And it was nice to see Andy Serkis getting his face on screen as Smeagol, before his transformation into Gollum.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, there were more than a few tears as the boat left the Grey Havens, as the movie ended on a quiet emotional note, after the epic battles before.<br/><br/>I could happily have sat through this again and again. Well done to everyone, both in front and behind the cameras for such a brilliant work, but of course special mention has to go to Peter Jackson. He deserves every award he's received for this.<br/><br/>One last point. If you only seen the theatrical release, then go get the extended version of this film. It's even better!!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Over the years, I've read Lord of the Rings four times. During the holiday season of 2003/4, I watched Return of the King four times. While I embraced ROTK as the third part of a dream come true, I was not totally happy, left wondering why so many things vital were missing. The 4-hour extended DVD version explains a lot.<br/><br/>My biggest beef was on so much missing about Aragon, and I found most of them in the DVD. One of the vital elements in the Fellowship's strategy is to draw Sauron's eye away from Frodo, and here Aragon's role is crucial. The \"last debate\" in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear, with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist.<br/><br/>Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER, not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD, although still missing a lot of details from the book.<br/><br/>Still disappointing, even for the DVD, is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate, although that's a least a slight improvement from the film version.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is Aragon's arrival at the Pelennor Fields, which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships, Aragon's standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: \"There flowered a White Tree, and that was for Gondor; but seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril gold.\" <br/><br/>The treatment of Gandalf's confrontation of the Witch King in the DVD departs from the book, in which the two are locked in a face off, then Rohan's horns are heard and the Witch King swings around and leaves. What in heaven's name is in Peter Jackson's mind when he had Gandalf's staff broken by the Witch King. But this did explain a mystery that has been bugging me for a year  why Gandalf had to snatch a spear from the guard when he saved Faramir from the pyre of Denethor.<br/><br/>Enough on the DVD.I shall be remiss if I do not pay tribute to Peter Jackson for the wonderful film he and his dedicated crew have created.<br/><br/>Most inspired is the lighting of the beacons to summon help from Rohan. In the book, this is observed by Pippin in the ride to Minas Tirith. To satisfy Pippin's curiosity, Gandalf explains the background to him in a somewhat factual manner. Jackson turns this into one of the most exciting moments in the film, with aesthetically superb shots of the 13 beacons (yes, I counted them) being lit up in succession, accompanied by beautifully rousing music score, culminating in Theoden's heroic utterance of \"Rohan will answer\". Watching this has to be among the most uplifting moments one can experience in a cinema.<br/><br/>Most poignant is the Faramir's suicidal attempt to retake Osgilaith, under the orders of an unloving father. Starting from the soldiers of Gondor filing out of Minas Tirith in what looks almost like a funeral march to the letting loose of the swarm of arrows by the orcs in Osgilaith, every image of this scene is so hauntingly heartrending. It reminds me of John Woo's favourite scenes, although here, the music is Pipppin's actual singing rather than adapted background music, rendering the tragic mood even more devastating.<br/><br/>Directly opposite in mood is Rohan's charge in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. Even if this mission is, in a way, equally suicidal, the spirit is sky high, radiating dauntless heroism and lust for battle. This scene also reminds me of the legendary battle scene in Spartacus (1960) which is universally recognised as the model in depiction of battle strategies. Rohan's charge in Pelennor Field, no the other hand, exemplifies heroism unsurpassed.<br/><br/>Although ROTK is first and foremost the King's story, we should not forget, in the overall scheme of things, the ring bearers (no typo here because Frodo did acknowledge Sam as a fellow ring bearer in the end of the book). Elijah Wood and Sean Astin (particularly Astin) have played their roles to perfection. Towards the end of the quest, when Frodo's strength was almost fully spent, to hear Sam say \"I cannot carry it (the ring) for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you\" and not be moved, one will have to be a hopelessly and irreversibly hardened cynic. The background music, incidentally, is \"Into the west\".<br/><br/>It is certainly a good sign that the general audience worldwide has reacted favourably to the long aftermath following the destruction of the ring, indicated that their capacity to appreciate has not been impaired by the proliferation of Hollywood style slam-bang endings. Viggo Mortensen's line to the Hobbits \"My friends, you bow to no one\" is delivered with sincerity and conviction. The final scene at the Grey Havens is graceful, touching, stylish. However, there is one shot that I must mention: Galadriel's final enigmatic, alluring, half-smiling glance at Frodo before she disappears into the ship. Cate Blanchett is among the most versatile actresses around today and in LOTR, she is Galadriel incarnate.</div>\n",

Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.<br/><br/>I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all.<br/><br/>This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen, he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time.<br/><br/>A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already begun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring.<br/><br/>A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn Frodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King, and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then, right after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final attempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.<br/><br/>In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains the most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy, and some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very successful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and of course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The Two Towers).<br/><br/>The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants; trolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but we're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this battle all the more superior.<br/><br/>Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.<br/><br/>Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the most moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves (Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.<br/><br/>All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made.</div>\n",

The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the only time in history a fantasy film has done so.<br/><br/>The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films, which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands, and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other, like jet planes waiting to land, the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that, for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subject; thrilling spectacle is underscored with palpable human drama, and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkien's books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Weary beyond words, Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring, with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.<br/><br/>With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. \"The Return of the King\" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.<br/><br/>Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.<br/><br/>Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in \"The Two Towers\" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with \"That still only counts as one\" - marvelous! <br/><br/>With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in \"The Hobbit\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!!**<br/><br/>Sequels are inherently difficult to make and review review, because on top of the usual expectations for a film, everyone has to deal with expectations created by the previous films. Return of the King faced expectations equal to those of any other film, and like the protagonists at Helm's Deep, fended them off and crushed them.<br/><br/>ROTK begins where \"The Two Towers\" concluded. As Gandalf said at the end of TTT, \"The battle for Helm's Deep is over; the battle for Middle Earth has begun.\" Frodo &amp; Sam are still moving toward Mordor; Merry &amp; Pippin are hanging out w/ the Ents at Isengard; and the rest of the fellowship has defeated the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep. With Saruman defeated, the focus now shifts east, where man must make a final stand against Sauron, while Frodo &amp; Sam attempt to destroy the One Ring.<br/><br/>As opposed to the breakneck opening scenes of TTT, ROTK starts slowly, but the early character development in lieu of action sequences is equally enjoyable and enlightening. Thank goodness for the deliberate beginning though, because if the intensity of the latter two-thirds of the film lasted for the full running time, paramedics would have been required on site to assist with heart failures and burst blood vessels, inevitable side effects of the remarkable tension that director Peter Jackson creates.<br/><br/>\n",
      "Speaking of Jackson, let's hear it for him and his crew (pause for standing ovation).<br/><br/>That crew has once again created a mythical world without a trace of fictitiousness. Through the jaw-dropping visualization of massive battles, fortresses, monsters, and more, the cinematography and effects uphold and improve the standard set by the predecessors. Gollum now has more to work with as an \"actor\", and the digital whiz kids step up to the challenge, blending him into the shots perfectly, particularly in a brilliant reflection scene. More sweeping battle scenes and more gorgeous landscapes are among the stellar shots lensed by Andrew Lesnie. The first shot of Minas Tirith stands to be my movie moment of the year; it will absolutely take your breath away. But the beauty lies in the fact that you scarcely know the difference between beautiful reality and equally natural effects. Outside of a couple apparent blue-screen shots, I never once doubted the veracity of the world of Middle Earth. Considering the enormity of that task, those at WETA Workshop who dazzled us with their talent deserve every award they get over the next couple months.<br/><br/>On the musical front, Howard Shore is back as composer, and his work shines as never before. He provides grand and booming orchestral sounds when battles require them, yet still manages to evoke emotion without lapsing into melodrama during poignant scenes. Mixing and tweaking familiar themes with new melodies, Shore literally hits all the right notes. For the audience, picking out recognizable themes, such that of Rohan or the Fellowship, and hearing how Shore has kicked them into a minor key or altered those last two notes is a thrill. His score is a joy to listen to, both as it seamlessly meshes with the film and on its own. Perhaps there can be no higher compliment.<br/><br/>Also of note is the use of vocal music voiced by the actors themselves, a technique that is new to the theatrical releases of LOTR. Of the two songs, I must mention the first one, which is utilized to stunning maximum effect. In a remarkable scene reminiscent of The Godfather, the song is sung over a scene that cuts between a character who made a decision and the grim consequences of that choice. The music, pictures, and variations in film speed combine for one of the best scenes of the year.<br/><br/>None of the acting work stood out to me, and by that I mean no individual was head-and-shoulders above the rest. I could still make a legitimate Oscar case for at least four cast members (Astin, McKellen, Mortensen, Wood), which is a tribute to the overall strength of the ensemble cast. Everyone fits into and builds upon their roles so very well, and the camaraderie that I've seen glimpses of behind the scenes carries over wonderfully.<br/><br/>\n",
      "The acting serves as a means rather than an end. A la \"Band of Brothers\", the combined ten hours of film allow time for the characters to be developed and known, an advantage fully used in ROTK, which has more fulfilling scenes packed with emotion where we see decisions being made. Those scenes are what elevate this film to another level. On top of the nonpareil action sequences that shame other \"epics\", it has a human soul, one that comes to the fore in final act, when the friendships that have been established take center stage. To me, friendship is the core theme of LOTR, and thanks to the fabulous acting of all participants, that theme is displayed in all its glory in ROTK.<br/><br/>WARNING! THE NEXT PARAGRAPH DISCUSSES THE CLOSING SCENES!!<br/><br/>\n",
      "In an unusual but welcome departure from the cinematic norm, the denouement of ROTK lasts a good twenty minutes after the climax. Too many movies, like \"Matrix Revolutions\", wrap too quickly, leaving fates either unresolved or resolved, but sloppily and unsatisfactorily. Others, such as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", do have an extended ending but don't require one and thus fill it with fluff. Here we find a perfect mean. Considering that Jackson and company have over ten hours of film and numerous character arcs to wrap up, twenty minutes is probably the minimum required to let the audience absorb all that has happened. After three or four possible end points, each of which concludes various stories, Sam returns to the Shire and enters his home, closing the door on both the camera and the trilogy. While the finish may seem odd, I consider it perfect. Sam has just come to the end of a fantastic adventure, a journey mirrored by that of the audience. The ending leaves each party back where they began, in a satisfying yet admittedly bittersweet manner. Like it or not, \"I'm back.\"<br/><br/>END OF MAJOR SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Is this film perfect? Probably not. Sure, certain characters like Denehor could have been developed more. But while that knowledge would have been helpful, the time it would have taken to expound on those people likely would not have been worth the knowledge gained. There are a handful of other cardinal sins, such as scarcely showing the ultimate villain and Arwen's near random appearances. But most of those trace back to the original books, not to errors by Peter Jackson. The fact that the entire series works so well without fully disclosing many details speaks to the phenomenal power of Tolkien's books and superb work in Jackson's films. The bottom line is that nobody cares about the flaws because they're entranced by the literary and cinematic magic on display.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: ROTK, the greatest final film in a trilogy of all time (go ahead...name a better one) culminates the best overall film trilogy ever, ten hours of film that transcend the medium. As I told my brother as we reluctantly but contentedly departed the theater, we will never experience anything like this again.  EVER.  10/10.</div>\n",

How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled<br/><br/>!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!<br/><br/>I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained , these epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it`s not a family film never mind a \" childish fantasy \" . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and Peter Jackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlative<br/><br/>There are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at last<br/><br/>As for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">After the last two Lord of the Rings films, the journey of so many heroes has come so far, and it all leads up to this. Darkness falls upon all of Middle-Earth. Huge armies of orcs march upon the kingdoms of men. The One Ring comes closer to its evil master. Could this be the end of the world, or the start of a new beginning? This final chapter in the film series starts off with an incredibly moving sequence: the heartbreaking tale of Gollum's origins. From the on, it picks right back up where the last films left off, chronicling the journey of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they tread in dark and dangerous territory, combating orcs, one giant spider, and ultimately themselves as they approach the threshold of Mount Doom. At the same time, the film presents some of the biggest and most epic scenes ever committed to film: the Battle of Minas Tirith. It is a huge spectacle that fills up the entire screen with thousands and thousands of orcs, men, war machines, lumbering beasts, Nazgûl, cavalry, massive elephants, and even ghosts. It is a long struggle that fills up most of the movie's runtime, but it's always awe-inspiring. As if that's not enough, the film then brings the battle to the gates of Mordor, for one grand climax. Even in the calm before each battle, the film remains as captivating as its predecessors, thanks to its style and storytelling prowess. If there's anything to truly complain about, it would be the lengthy denouement. Overall, however, the experience of The Return of the King has never failed to invoke feelings of awe.<br/><br/>At this point, the characters of the film are well-established and intimately familiar, but the film does take its time to explore more of the familiar faces and elaborate on fresh new characters. They all come together to contribute to the multiple conflicts, tying every strand of the plot to one epic climax; it's a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant, and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels, but for the big screen, it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war, corruption, addiction, good and evil, and adventure all prevail.<br/><br/>As before, this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles (especially Viggo Mortensen, who stands out more in this film than before, but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf, along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies). Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are huge; at its time, it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit, the effects are still impressive. Howard Shore's music score is as masterful as ever.<br/><br/>Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy (and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end). Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles, but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites (was my number-one favorite for quite a few years), and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle, storytelling, and style.<br/><br/>If you watch the Extended Edition of this film, you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes, which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions, there are longer battle scenes, a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue, an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead, a parley with the Mouth of Sauron, and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome, and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)</div>\n",

His favorite possession is his plastic sword! Yesterday, going to the movie, he asked me if I could get him a parrot to sit on his shoulder! <br/><br/>He loved the movie and gave it two \"thumbs up\" (both his)!

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was expecting this movie to be bad, and it was even worse than I expected. I have seen some truly terrible movies in my time like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and any of the Friedburg-Seltzer movies. But Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 brings the phrase \"terrible movie\" to a new level. And believe me, that is being kind about this piece of garbage. I am truly not surprised that it is in the bottom 100, it deserves to be there. That is how bad it is, and it highly deserved the 4 Razzie nominations it received. If you thought the first movie was bad, and it was, this is even worse. Sorry if I sound harsh, but I am trying to be honest.<br/><br/>The dialogue was absolutely excruciating. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a six year old. It completely lacked sophistication and humour. And guess how many times I laughed during this movie? You guessed right, not even once! The plot was lazy, uninspired and clumsy. The idea of a media mogul wanting to dominate the world? How many times has this being done before? Loads, and much better might I add. The direction was sluggish and never reached its focus. Even worse than the dialogue, direction and plot were the fight sequences. How tedious were they? Very, not to mention very inappropriate, even for a family movie.<br/><br/>The performances from the entire cast were exceedingly poor. Jon Voight has pulled off some good performances in the past. However, I truly think he was held at gunpoint to star in this mess. And he gives the worst performance of his entire career here, acquiring a simply dreadful German accent that has to be among the worst ever accents in film history. It was worse than his accent in Anaconda, honestly there were times when I couldn't understand what he was saying. The other performers weren't that much better either, Scott Baio especially was wasted. And the child performers were misguided, they just couldn't do anything with the script. And I do apologise here, but I don't think babies trying to behave like adults is cute or funny in the slightest.<br/><br/>Even the camera work was next to abysmal, nothing more than flat and rushed. Shame really, because there was one or two nice bits of scenery. In fact, the only real half decent element of this this otherwise abysmal film was the music, and even that was forgettable at best. All in all, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was nothing more than a piece of garbage, that was the low point of Jon Voight's acting career. 0/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again, just call Jon Voight. Yeah, the same Jon Voight who won an Academy Award as best actor in 1978 for \"Coming Home.\" The star of \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Catch-22\" and \"Conrack\" -- you know, Angelina Jolie's dad.<br/><br/>Why bother Mr. Voight? Well, considering that he's lending his name to \"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2,\" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in \"SuperBabies,\" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in, instead of \"Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid\" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first \"Anaconda\" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows, then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original \"Baby Geniuses.\" Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner, it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel, of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.<br/><br/>So here he is, ladies and gentlemen, outfitted with not one, but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane, a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made, insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly, Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry, Leo and Myles Fitzgerald, who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case, and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming, it's \"a small fry with a big attitude\" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as \"Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?\" and \"Never send a man to do a boy's job.\"<br/><br/>Kahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler, in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections, too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg, the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town, or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that \"every child has power -- all you have to do is believe,\" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.<br/><br/>There are other four SuperBabies, too, and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons, this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel, where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown), Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead), Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).<br/><br/>Watching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel, as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed, and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin, who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.<br/><br/>As was the case with \"Baby Geniuses,\" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If \"SuperBabies\" is marginally better than the excruciating \"Geniuses\" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.<br/><br/>By the way, Voight's next project is called \"The Karate Dog,\" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex, Pat Morita and Chevy Chase, who'll provide \"the voice of Cho-Cho,\" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really, the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks.</div>\n",

She certainly picked a dandy.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not going into how awful the characters were or how weak the plot was, etc. etc. Just know as an adult you'll hate it, but if you want to keep your kids (under 9 years old) out of mischief for an hour and a half then pop this in the DVD player. My 3 year was just mesmerized. Don't think she has ever sat that long while watching a movie.<br/><br/>I rated it 5/10 ... since I personally give it a 1 and my kids would say 10 ... so ...

      "<div class=\"content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Okay, the first movie from this series \"Baby Geniuses\" was so poorly received that reviewers were beside themselves castigating the film. It currently is ranked #73 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Yet, astoundingly, the film led to this even worse sequel--\"Baby Geniuses 2\"! This sort of sequel is a prime example how some people in Hollywood just need to get real jobs...or at least stop doing LSD! Unlike the first horrible piece of garbage that is \"Baby Geniuses\", this film manages to be significantly worse for several important reasons: <br/><br/>1. It is totally unoriginal. While \"Baby Geniuses\" was dumb, it was somewhat original and perhaps the film makers naively thought the film would sell. Here, however, they knew they were producing a giant stinky diaper of a film from the onset--following the horrible drubbing the first film received--and yet they STILL made it!<br/><br/>2. \"Baby Geniuses 2\" has some of the absolute worst computer work I've seen in a recent film. The babies are horribly dubbed as their computer generated lip movements didn't match--and in some cases looked really creepy.<br/><br/>3. Jon Voight managed to do a much, much worse job as the villain compared to the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner in the original. That took LOTS of effort! Lots and lots and lots of effort!<br/><br/>4. A ninja baby! While one of the babies in the original film did some karate here and there, here we have an honest-to-goodness ninja baby--complete with ninja mask and insanely ridiculous wire-fu stunts.<br/><br/>5. Two words about the second film that say it all...SCOTT BAIO! <br/><br/>6. Even more pop culture references that no child would understand. Considering that 99.9% of the people who actually wanted to see the film were children, this is a serious problem.<br/><br/>7. The @&amp;*$ kids talk and talk and make commentary on EVERYTHING. It's like going to a movie with an annoying kid sitting next to you who thinks he's the host of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and talks throughout--but in reality, he is just an obnoxious child who won't shut up. PLEASE shut up!!! SHUT UP!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!! <br/><br/>8. Gadgets! Unlike the first film, this one gives the ninja kid all kinds of super gadgets, such as a car like the Batmobile that spouts flames out the back, a James Bond-like mini-copter and Dick Tracy communication devices.<br/><br/>9. The ninja baby has his own version of the Bat Cave--complete with holograms and Willie Wonka-like accessories.<br/><br/>10. In many ways, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" is like the first film merged with \"Spy Kids 2\"--another bad kids film. It manages to combine the worst qualities of each! <br/><br/>11. The ninja kid is a Buddhist with super-powers. As a result, now nearly 1 billion Buddhists worldwide also hate this film. Instead of offending this religion, they should have attacked a fringe cult like the Movementarians.<br/><br/>12. A romance between two teenagers that just seemed a bit creepy. Seeing two teens kiss who look a lot younger than their actual age made me feel a bit queasy. My 19 year-old said she felt the same.<br/><br/>13. For the cost of \"Baby Geniuses 2\", they could have funded ten independent films...or more. While this isn't a huge budget film, it cost a lot of money for the special effects. What a sad waste.<br/><br/>14. Towards the end of the film, several babies sprout super-powers. One is like Superman and can fly, one shoots magic arrows, one is a giant bouncy ball (how that can come in handy against the villains is anyone's guess) and one is \"Brain Boy\" (whatever that means).<br/><br/>15. The last 10 minutes...oh, does it suck! No, it Mega-sucks! <br/><br/>16. The end of the film rips off Bogie from \"Casablanca\"--what sorry sacrilege.<br/><br/>Overall, this is truly a horrible film. While there might be films that look crappier or have worse production values, the fact that this one DOES have a decent budget and production values yet is this thoroughly horrible makes this an amazing film. Clearly, it deserves to be on IMDb's infamous list! At one point, one of the babies make a comment that would be the perfect description of this sequel--\"Oh no, I'm feeling nauseous again\".</div>\n",

It's meant to make the young ones laugh and the adults cringe In embarrassment! I find It rather sad that so many adults have so many bad things to say about a film so obviously not Intended for them! Why would a story about super-toddlers be aimed at a target audience above 13 anyway? This movie Is a laugh and a bit of imagination fun for the little-ones and It does It's job - the sets and effects are poor because they don't need to be any better and after all the whole thing Is pretty tongue-In-cheek! Super-hero kids take on the bad guys - what more can pre-teens ask for? The kids liked It and that's what counts!</div>\n",

The horrible characters Jon Voight as a Neo-Nazi is one step away from doing xxx porn. A steep decline for an actor who once received an Academy Award(Coming Home) At the screening I attended no less than 12,of the families attending walked out a third of the way through leaving 5, brave families in the theatre .And there was no laughter even from the kids . This film has studio tax write-off written all over it. Why it wasn't sent direct to video is a mystery for the ages. Some studio exec actually thought this would make money ?!?!!!! The animated baby talking is horribly done; the mouth movements never match the actual words . It is said you can learn just as much from a bad movie as a good one. The only thing I learned here is that Hollywood has been taken far astray from its roots . Whoever gave this dirty diaper the green light should be fired or made to watch this over and over and over ........</div>\n",

Plus, all the babies in the film speak like they are in an educational T.V. show, and the storyline is, somewhat, fair. But what I did not like was, too much time in baby world, lack of character introductory, the four babies in-film are supposedly supporting roles, due to them being sidekicks of Kahuna. The humor is, indeed, lacked, and Bob Clark chose a poor movie to direct, although his final, because it is now one of the worst films of all time.</div>\n",

Three girls, one 5 and 2 are 7, completely enjoyed most of the film. And why not? The kids are cute, the villain is villainous, the line between good and evil is clearly marked and the good guys win. They particularly liked the \"toys\" and the personalities of the children. Without spoiling it, the ending was plenty exciting for them. I am glad we took them, regardless of what I thought of the film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first \"Baby Geniuses\" movie was inane and boring enough, why make a sequel? Are studios that hard up to make money? That scared of trying something different for fear of losing money? I guess they figure going with a franchise that has a proved record of mediocrity is safer - at least you're not surprised when you lose money. This film is not campy or cheesy bad, it's just plain boring bad - the worst kind of cinematic experience.<br/><br/>I guess my reason for writing a review of a movie this bad several years after its release is this - Parents, if you're looking for family-safe entertainment, you can do better than this type of film. Your kids are smarter than this. If they're young enough not to mind sitting through this film, then they are too young to enjoy any kind of movie anyways. For family-safe entertainment you can never go wrong with just about anything made by Pixar. Pixar knows how to make films that use CGI to accentuate already good plots and interesting characters, not as a substitute for them.<br/><br/>As for this film, it makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane. 20 years from now if there is a \"Mystery Science 4000\" to replace the now defunct MST3K, I'm sure this film will be one of the featured objects of ridicule... if the poor robots can stand the torment of sitting through it.</div>\n",

But what unfolded was truly a bomb - neither funny nor coherent. Thank goodness these don't come along that often.<br/><br/>Other than a flatulence joke in the first 5 minutes of the film (now a requirement for children's cinema), the laughs were few and far between in the remaining 90 minutes of this movie. During the many long periods of boredom, many questions began racing through my head. Why are these babies talking? Why do we care? Why aren't they saying anything funny?<br/><br/>I can only assume that Jon Voight has a grandchild/godchild/nephew/niece, for whom he dedicated this performance. There really could be no other plausible reason for such an actor to associate with something with so little merit.</div>\n",

Believe me, I've had to sit through some bad kid flix, but this one is an all time loser. There is a woman with very large lips (Vanessa Angel) who almost makes it bearable, just for the pure fascination of watching whether or not they will explode.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The one star reviewers are 100% correct. This \"movie\" is horrendous! The first movie stunk like government cheese so it should be of no surprise that this sequel stinks. The so-called plot revolves around some evil media mogul named Biscane(played by Jon Voight)with some wacky scheme revolving around mind control on kids through the TV screen. The baby \"geniuses headed by Kahuna plan to take on Biscane and cheesy hijinks ensue. The plot is horrible and the acting is just as bad. Scott Baio should have bowed out gracefully since Charles In Charge went off the air but no he chose to be here. Jon Voight usually shines even when he is in a bad movie but here he hams it up like its going out of style. Plus Jon Voight being in this movie shows you how far some actors are willing to go for a pay check. I mean doesn't he and Christopher Walken have enough pride to not star in the trash films they starred in? The jokes are why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road corny but it seems that the director believes that a crappy jokes are funny when it comes from toddlers. WRONG! Crappy jokes are still crappy jokes even if it comes from children. What kind of milk you drinkin? Who wrote this script? the writers of Howard The Duck? If you like this movie you are the moronic target audience. This movie is bad enough to make a kid cry and as a matter of fact, I let my niece watch it and she was bored to tears. No, I'm not being mean-spirited, this movie is not even so bad its good. Its so bad its terrible. Only a shill could recommend this atrocity to celluloid. Jon Voight should fire his agent and Scott Baio should quit while people still have fond memories of him. Two Thumbs WAAAAAYYYYYYY down!</div>\n",

But this film was truly one of the worst films I've ever sat through.  What was Jon Voight thinking when he accepted this role.  Surely it couldn't have been purely financial.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Terrible. That's just one word that could describe this pile of diaper entertainment. Another movie is unwatchable. I had to sit through this garbage while watching some kids one day, and I knew this movie wasn't good when even the kids lost interest a few minutes in. There are movies where the kids get into the action, they cheer on the good guys, or they involve themselves into the movie. Not this one. Superbabies entertained none of the kids, and left me wondering how this movie ever left the boardroom where the script was written. The movie did solve one question that had been burning inside of me for a while: Where has Scott Baio been? Here, he plays a father of one of the babies and director of a new daycare center that may or may not be integral in the plot to take over the world by the diabolical Biscane (Jon Voight). I can understand Baio being in this movie, he hasn't really been in demand of late. But when I see Voight perform in this movie, I wonder to myself \"Why?\" He's done some good work of late, notably in Holes and National Treasure, and then he plays some sort of super villain with a bad German accent who is derailed by 2 year-olds. He'll bounce back, he has to. The babies in the movie, who are supposed to be the stars, looks freaky to me. The voices do not sync up with the movie lips at all. I think the characters in South Park have better synchronization than these babies. And the movie is not funny either. Again, I go to the kids, where I noticed none of them laughed at all. Instead, they all wanted to read, or draw, or take a nap, or do their laundry. Anything to escape this movie.</div>\n",

I suggest IMDb add zero to the rating system for seriously unwatchable movies such as this one.<br/><br/>Superbabies has made a thing of filming some toddlers, then adding poorly synced voice-over to make them \"talk\". Turns out, this is not inherently funny, in fact, it's mostly annoying. To not just make a movie about a couple of babies having a nonsense conversation, they make the toddlers do things, by the use of some pretty lackluster special effects, not bad enough to be funny and not good enough to be believable, just bad. <br/><br/>And what do the film makers do with these walking, talking babies? They have them be the main characters of the most annoyingly anti-funny, excruciatingly inane action comedy I have ever seen. Example 1: The \"evil henchmen\" (my heroes) have cornered the main character, but instead of shooting him (and ending the movie early), they engage him in stupid comedy fist fight. Example 2: When the \"good guys\" (the villains in my book) manage to steel the CD of doom (or whatever) from the evil mastermind, they don't just destroy it (and end the movie), instead they have another \"comedy\" fight over it. Unfunny slapstick action starring babies, repeated in ad nauseum seems to be the recipe for this entire film.<br/><br/>I actually felt slightly sick while seeing this movie, I implore you, don't make the same mistake I did, see any other movie than this one, heck it could even be another movie off the bottom 100 list.</div>\n",

Despite his shitty movie \"A Christmas Story\", he has got to be the best director of our generation. Kubrick literally has nothing on him. The casting is also fantastic: The 3 Fitzgerald brothers returned, thankfully. Their schedules are busy with cinema opportunities, we all know, but I'm so thankful that they could return. Please, if you have any free time, watch this movie. It's literally the best creation on Planet Earth. I've never seen anything like this masterpiece. Please, do it for me.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was eagerly waiting for this film and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Baahubali is one of the most visually impressive films that have come from India. Everything about this film is good - Story, direction, beautiful cinematography, haunting score and amazing visuals (though they lack some details at some places). <br/><br/>I didn't know who Rajamouli was, basically because I am from North India and I don't follow south Indian cinema. But I am sure he is someone you should know about. SS Rajamouli is amazing. He has made something that we can be proud of. I was sure that the VFX would be good however I had a doubt about the story. Rajamouli proved me wrong with this film. The story and the execution is really good. Story takes elements from Indian mythologies (specially from the life of Lord Krishna) . You can not expect more. He took a big risk and made it big. This is what we need, good quality cinema. Salman fans should learn something from it. <br/><br/>All the actors are good and perform their part really well(except Tamanna. She tries too hard but fails miserably). In fact, Tamanna has been used as a plot device (A MacGuffin as Alfred Hitchcock used to call it). Prabhas is okay in the beginning but transforms into a behemoth during the second half. This guy is a natural. He doesn't act exceptionaly but his presence is enough to give you the feels.<br/><br/>The background score needs special mention because it is amazing. It is different from anything you have ever heard in India. The score that plays during war is haunting. (Clearly inspired from the LotR) <br/><br/>I would be lying if I didn't say that Rajamouli spent a lot of time watching The Lord of The Rings. Yes, some scenes will remind you of 300 and the Lord of The Rings but believe me it is completely different. He doesn't copy anything, he uses it as a source of inspiration. There is only one scene that I remember from LotR which has been used in Baahubali. But denying that he was influenced by Peter Jackson would be a big lie. Its a great thing that he was influenced by such a great film otherwise we wouldn't have Baahubali.<br/><br/>The quality of graphics work is very good. In fact its insane for such a cheap price given that Hollywood uses big budget for the same. The battle sequence is SPECTACULAR and reminded me of Battle of Helm's Deep and Pelennor fields from LotR.<br/><br/>But the movie is not without some minor problems. There are unnecessary songs which ruin the experience (I laughed so hard when Prabhas started dancing randomly. Everyone was looking at me.) and some parts are dragged (specially the first half) . Also there are continuity problems and some actors are over-the-top. Cut down the songs and edit the movie and voilà we will have a SPECTACULAR film.<br/><br/>Baahubali is not the answer to 300, Gladiator or The Lord of The Rings because saying so would be foolish. Don't compare this movie to the Hollywood ones because we still have a long way to go. It's not the Indian 300, its Indian \"Baahubali\".<br/><br/>So in the end, I would like to say - Go and watch it instead of watching the crap that Bollywood has been producing lately. Its something to be proud of. Book your tickets and watch this Indian grand spectacle. You wont regret it. P.S: I want to see Rajamouli doing \"Mahabharata\" next.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">If a person is bit of into movies, I am sure that person heard about Baahubali couple of years back. It took almost four years to complete the first part. Hero Prabhas had completely dedicated his time to this movie and no movie after his super successful movie Mirchi. Same is true from S.S Rajamouly, after his last non-conventional movie Eega. So obviously there are high expectations.<br/><br/>I was eagerly waiting for this movie and within no time I booked the tickets and went with my family. The results are out now, history books are being rewritten. An excellent movie, every frame is a mega scale. I couldn't remember a single scene which I felt bored. This movie will redefine Indian movie standards. Nothing less than The Lord of the Rings or in fact, can easily compete with any Hollywood movie. <br/><br/>Each and every character superbly framed. Every actor has done a decent job and Prabhas and Raana are over the sky, earned more than 100% credit. Can't wait for part 2. <br/><br/>Overall It's a superb visual treat.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Can't imagine I'm the only one who found my way to this two-part Indian epic after salivating over \"RRR.\"<br/><br/>\"Bahubali\" doesn't meet \"RRR\" standards, but few things would. Made a few years earlier, this film looks much cheaper -- some of the CGI is so bad that the movie almost looks like a video game cut scene at times. And the actors just don't hold the screen the way the two leads in \"RRR\" did. It started to really lose me toward the end, during a loooong battle scene that feels interminable and made my eyes start to glaze over. If I'd known going in that what starts as a flashback wouldn't so much be a flashback as the actual real story of the movie, I would have been prepared. But as it is, the transition into a whole different story at the mid-way point really threw me and killed what momentum the film had been building.<br/><br/>Not completely satisfying as a stand-alone experience, but it does improve a bit when taken with the second part.<br/><br/>Grade: B.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">3 years of sheer hard-work of many people who have worked their hearts out for this Visual Wonder has paid off well? Not exactly though, since the answer is simple and straight, you just have to wait for the 'Conclusion' till 2016 and that would decide the fate of this franchise on a whole. The story is paced slowly in the first half giving way and screen space to our Mother Nature's beauty and CGI's magic and one might find it a little too draggy if one considers 'Baahubali' to solely be a hero and since that's not possible, Shivudu has a love life and heroic nature and scenes of his own.Abrupt cuts and unconvincing CGI at certain places in first half are the only flaws with the whole film. Coming to the second half, one is told what he'd expect to be told, as the trailer tells the same. War sequences are really well shot and makes it hard to believe that they were actually made by Indians! One has to just bow down to Srinivas Mohan and his team for excellent CGI and Senthil Kumar for superb visuals. Our captain gives us a bang, as his trademark style known as 'Interval Bang' only at the end this time because technically this movies' end is the interval for the 2 parts taken as a whole. Art work in this Epic is just out of the world, kudos to Sabu Cyril sir and thousands of technicians who worked on this aspect.BGM is soothing for the first half which is apt for what we get on screen and the second half war episodes get the best of the lot BGMs to elevate the scenes. Songs are places really well except for 'Manohari' song.Dolby Atmos effect is an added attraction and I highly recommend people to watch this flick in theatres with this specific sound system, it will surely remain as a great experience for you. The sound effects are haunting, pleasing and give you goosebumps at the same time. Anushka had an extended cameo but did perform commendably well, special applause to her expressions. Special mention to Ramya Krishna madame, she was at her best! Katappa will blow your mind with his characteristics and Sathya Raj Sir does 100% justice to it. Though Prabhas and Rana Daggubati did well only their attitude in their respective roles stands out as the best because more of them is yet to come in the sequel. All you need to do is to watch the movie as it comes because expectations lead to disappointment. If you miss this movie, you've just lost a once in life-time 'Indian' movie experience on a big screen.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I'm a big fan of Rajamouli, but this is not a biased review. The rating I gave is not just for Rajamouli but the entire unit of Baahubali. Right from the story which reminded me of all the beautiful Indian stories that were part of my childhood,(I'm getting back to reading Amar Chitra Katha now!!!) to every guy who says \"Baahubali\" in the movie. There were several scenes that gave me goosebumps, not scary ones but like those that put you in awe.<br/><br/>It should just get better from here for Indian Cinema. This should be the benchmark for story telling, direction, script, visuals, sets, screenplay etc.(but not for acting!!!)<br/><br/>The story keeps you hooked to the movie. I wouldn't say too many good things about the movie as they may contain spoilers. But I could compare the movie to a good mythological comic that you would like to read again and again.(So I'm watching the movie again tomorrow!!!)<br/><br/>But I would like to mention why I reduced the two stars 1. The make up was not at all good. Especially Anushka's <br/><br/>2. The costumes could be better, probably more realistic(if you compare costumes in Troy or even Hercules, they were more relevant) <br/><br/>3. At times people in the background were not true to the scene, my concentration was distracted due to some idiots who didn't match the scene. A few villagers, few priests, few classical dancers, few tribal guys. The Kalakeya warriors were amazing though. <br/><br/>4. WHO THE HELL CHOSE TO PUT AN ITEM SONG. There were many uufffs in the theatre at that time. How the hell did probably an eastern European end up in that. <br/><br/>5. There were a few glitches in the VFX, like whenever the hero is jumping around... it made it look unnatural. That's poor graphics. I'm not an expert on this but few of those jumping sequences could be avoided. You don't see them in Hollywood mythological except for superhero movies which are more convincing.<br/><br/>But not too many complaints about that as I understand there are certain budget constraints for VFX but Makeup, there is no excuse for that.<br/><br/>All said and done, it was a fantastic movie and worth the wait and ends with a nice climax which keeps you guessing the 2nd half story. <br/><br/>My favourite characters were Sivagami and Kattappa. I am in love with Ramya Krishna again. I'm watching it again tomorrow.</div>\n",

And after one song they are in love. 2. A sad mother waiting for his son to take revenge. \"Mere karan Arjun aayenge\". 3. Hero has enormous superhuman like strength and intelligence without any battle training and can beat 20 people with weapons bare handed. 4. Physics is just ignored. 5. Plot copied from movies 300 (Trishul battle defence), Troy, Matrix trilogy (the chosen one concept, multiple fight scenes), Lord of the Rings etc.<br/><br/>People said this was best VFX ever. Best VFX is the one where after watching the scene you say - I wonder where they shot this movie-this place is so beautiful. Which means although movie looks aesthetically pleasing but VFX is \"undetectable\". The moment you are able to VFX is being used, it becomes pathetic VFX.<br/><br/>This movie highlights starvation and craving of us Indians for watching a half a decent movie, so much so, that a clichéd with non-existent plot is said to be the best Indian movie ever and is reinforced by the fact that everyone else likes it - Typical Herd Mentality. This movie is Andho mein Kaana Raja. (One eyed man is King among blind people). It is almost like religion, people have desire to give their life a bigger meaning even there isn't one, and they hold on to this meaning so dearly that all logic seems to become their enemy.</div>\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed the paid preview . Its a first real tribute from film industry to the greatest epics of all time \"The Mahabharata\" .<br/><br/>Luring action sequence and VFX and one of the nicest delivered again from south .<br/><br/>Making bollywood look bad again in India , its absolutely not catching up with the southern films .<br/><br/>I am a north Indian and not a great fan of south but they really making bollywood run for its money spree .<br/><br/>First I then Kanchana 2 and now the mighty Bahubali .<br/><br/>Story - 9/10 Acting - 8/10 Visuals - 10/10 <br/><br/>Overall 9/10</div>\n",

Not everyday are we going to get movies like this. Don't keep high expectations about the movie, unless you have seen previous Rajamouli films ;) (like Magadheera, Eega). I would definitely say watch on bigger screens like imax or xd. Background score is simply awesome and as usual rajamouli makes best use of the music for his sets. <br/><br/>Visuals are good. All characters did their part. Cannot name anyone particularly. I liked the main character most. I will be watching the movie at least two more times :). Hope y'all njoy it.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I know nothing about Indian Cinema. If Baahubali is the standard, then I'm in for a spectacular and wildly fun ride.<br/><br/>I decided to watch Baahubali on Netflix about a year ago. As I knew nothing of Indian Cinema beforehand and really little about the story of the film itself, I had slightly low expectations that it would be an okay martial arts film. Fortunately, all my low expectations were shattered by this incredible work of art.<br/><br/>The acting for the archetypal and relatable characters is spot-on. I really want to check out what else Prabhas has done since he is so cool in this movie. I kind of noticed a similarity between Mahendra and Son Goku in the Dragon Ball franchise in that Mahendra is a free-spirited and kind-hearted fighter who stands up for the weak and fights against bullies, basically like Goku. The villain's actor is quite physically imposing and it's fascinating to see how in flashbacks we see how he become the character he is. I felt the female lead for Mahendra's storyline was a little underdeveloped in terms of character and the story kind of pushes her aside as a secondary character in regards to the general plot.<br/><br/>The music is definitely one of the selling points of this film as well as the incredible dance sequences. There are some really great song and dance pieces throughout this movie and they are far better pieces than what you see in Disney's live-action musical remakes, and that even includes the masterpiece remake of Beauty and the Beast, in my opinion. I love all the songs in this film, but for some reason I really enjoy the sequence near the beginning with Mahendra lifting the metal totem of Shiva and carrying it over to the waterfalls and a cool-sounding chant-prayer plays on the soundtrack with some awesome drumming as well. Also, the song and music that plays when Mahendra summons his strength and starts climbing the waterfall mountain is iconic, beautiful, and quite honestly majestic.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie are the other selling point. Several of the fight scenes are right out of a Zack Snyder movie, but the climatic battle sequence near the end between the city defenders and the barbarian horde invaders (Sorry, couldn't remember how to spell their tribal name or the city, either) is right out of The Return of the King and The Battle of the Five Armies. I'd say it's definitely one of the top ten medieval battle sequences I've ever seen. Really amazing and thrilling.<br/><br/>And that cliffhanger ending. The final line (and subsequent related image) uttered is a jaw-dropping shocker and just makes you want to load up the next film in the Netflix queue.<br/><br/>#RestoreTheSnyderverse!</div>\n",

They are mostly copied in their entirety from Hollywood, Hong Kong or other cinema industries or at least bit and pieces shamelessly plagiarized. This most expensive movie coming out of India is no different. I wonder where did they spend the money because CGI looked like 80s work. Scenes changing from hot tropical climate to snow laden ground yet people running around only in summer clothes, leaping unbelievable distances even for a fantasy movie. I was pressured into watching this waste of time and money from my Indian peers. And as usual I have sworn, I am never gonna listen to them again but I know it will happen. My advice stay away from this for the sake of your own sanity.</div>\n",

Be it the snow-clad mountains, palatial sets or stark battleground infested with CGI-enhanced cavalry and infantry, Bahubali is magnificent to look at (take a bow, cinematography-K K Senthil Kumar, production design-Sabu Cyril).The first part of the epic leaves behind dollops of rip-roaring entertainment to relish till it's back to finish what it started in perhaps even more jaw-dropping manner.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie cannot even be considered a B movie. I personally do not like musicals and i believe it just lowers the quality of a movie. Since almost all Indian movies are musicals , leave it here. But calling this movie the best movie from India is a big insult to Indian movie industry. <br/><br/>Let me start with acting. Although side role characters are OK , the acting from main main characters is simply horrible, actually i do not even want to elaborate.<br/><br/>Story has no depth and full of gaps and inconsistencies, but is kind of a cheap remake of the story of prophet Moses, the difference finding family is good but the real family is bad . You cannot understand why many of the occurrences happen. Also war scene is almost stolen from troy , same shield wall, two brothers.... <br/><br/>Our muscular hero is something above Hercules and any demigod or god you can name from mythologies , cannot be harmed and gets stronger when he is angry like Hulk . He is so romantic and speaks like the lowest quality poems. <br/><br/>Even in the most unbelievable fantasy movie you can make some explanations over the world they have created , but here you can expect catapults to shoot burning fabric and kill 100 thousand people .... Why would you add so many stunt man and walking-on players and not even make a proper war scene. <br/><br/>If you cannot find anything to watch and so bored , even than don't watch this one , go watch brave heart or troy 11 th time .</div>\n",

The main character can do anything like fighting 1000s of soldiers with a sword, hold a 1000 kg idol with just a rope, jump from mountains and catch a falling guy. Too many unrealistic scenes. Story line is very weak. Vfx looks OK nothing great. All characters having fake and funny beards. Just an overrated movie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">To be portrayed as the biggest Indian spectacle till date is a heavy accolade to hold, let alone achieve. And baahubali is definitely not up to the mark.<br/><br/>Let's look at the movie objectively:<br/><br/>1) Starting with the most talked about aspect of the movie VFX/CGI. The CGI is so over the top that it felt like a badly edited video game at times. For instance, the scene in which Baahubali is running away from the guards in the fort. <br/><br/>Loud and showy landscapes can not be termed as spectacular CGI. It should merge seamlessly with the movie and CGI stands out like a sore thumb in this one.<br/><br/>2)Acting: Its loud and crass to say the least. The reactions of all characters after every dialogue reminds a bit of the daily soaps.<br/><br/>3)StoryLine: Its old and repetitive from a 1000 other movies of the same genre. A messiah who comes to save the day. Yes, that's never been done before in Indian cinema.<br/><br/>However, despite all the above points Baahubali puts in a valiant effort. But to compare it to the likes of Lord of the Rings and Hobbit with the sheer depth of Tolkien's work is sacrilege. No where near that league.<br/><br/>Only recommended for the faithful. <br/><br/>Rating: 2/5</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sometimes a movie comes along that causes a revolution in film history. A movie that people aspire to copy from and is talked about for the better half of a century. A movie which gets embedded in cultural history, and influences a whole generation. It stands as a symbol of pure art and culture, portraying the beauty, that is cinema.<br/><br/>This is not that movie. This is an ego-trip, following the need to present a spectacle to a spectacle-hungry audience which has never needed anything philosophical or intellectual. For such an audience, a simplistic plot and beautiful visuals are needed, which this film caters to. But beyond that, we cannot be persuaded to find any relevance of such an endeavor. The ideas and people get lost behind the purported veil of glamor and show. This leads to a disconnect from the characters themselves and we are left with a pot boiler which fizzles out before it even heats up. It'll leave you wanting, nay, craving to know the end and you will shell out even more of your money to follow it through. *sigh* The times we live in.</div>\n",

First I have to say that some of the graphics was pretty good. The plot was legendary and epic. The problems are: Kattappa. The real reason Kattappa must have killed Bahubali is that Bahubali has the habit of putting his leg on Kattappa's head. WTF. It should be no mystery. It was a righteous kill. Bahubali deserved it. Also he inadvertantly told Tamanna she is supposed to be a woman and a woman should wear make-up and look pretty. That is all. Item song falls in the middle neither good nor bad. Despite that it is just average. The good ratings are because of hype. When people say that this movie is the answer to LOTR or Troy I get annoyed because, why should this movie be an answer to anything. I did not know that there was a ? after LOTR or Troy. Lord Of The Rings? Troy? Even then the question would be have you watched LOTR or Troy and the answer would be yes or no not Bahubali.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">When it is announced that tollywood is embarking on a first of its kind visual \"epic\", curiosity rose to the skies, the budget (250 crores), the stellar cast and the technicians all brought goose pimples to tollywood audience, especially when it was announced that the story was so mammoth it needed two parts to tell it. While we walk into the multiplex screening this mammoth spectacle of epic proportions, we prepare ourselves for a visual grandeur of a la Cleopatra, ten commandments, Spartacus or even Ben-hur, but sadly that was not to be, and \"BAHUBALI\" does disappoint on lot of areas, primarily the screenplay and the story.<br/><br/>The movie begins with queen mother Sivagami (Ramyakrishna) trying to save an infant from some soldiers and dies just after handing over the baby to a tribal queen Sanga (Rohini). Rohini christens the boy as Sivudu (Prabhas), who actually develops an infatuation over a mountain peak and wants to see what lies beyond it.<br/><br/>One day he succeeds in his mission and goes over the peak and runs into a rebel Avanthika (Tamannah Bhatia) and falls for her. Avanthika is on a rescue mission to save a certain Devasena (Anushka Shetty) who was imprisoned by the cruel king Balala Deva (Daguppati Rana) for more than 25 years. Devasena is waiting anxiously for her son to come and rescue her, though repeated requests from her loyalist Kattappa (Sathyaraj) to free her fell on deaf ears.<br/><br/>Sivudu, takes over the mission from Avanthika and enters the kingdom of Mahishmathi to rescue Devasena. He succeeds in rescuing her and also killing the crown prince. Out in the wilderness, he learns the truth about his father Bahubali (prabhas again) and how he was treacherously killed by none other than..........................<br/><br/>Sure, the movie was mounted on a mammoth scale, but what was lacking was a proper storyline. I know fans of the actors would argue that the real story is in the part II and this was just giving us a taste of what was to come. Well! I still say that they should have done a better job at giving us a good taste. The battle scene (only one) was neatly choreographed by Peter Heins and yes it does bring to memory lot of Hollywood epic battle scenes most notably 300 and Troy.<br/><br/>Anushka Shetty was breathtakingly horrific as Devasena, her eyes spewing venom and the prosthetic makeup on her was natural and radiated a kind of zombiesque look, but it was magnificent.<br/><br/>Tamannah Bhatia was the surprise package, she looked glamorous in the strip battle scene ( a format borrowed heavily from Zorro series starring Catherina Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas) and was chilling as the blood thirsty rebel hacking and chopping her way in her actual introduction sequence.<br/><br/>The movie belongs to RamyaKrishna who takes charge as Sivagami and radiates an immense presence even in scenes where she is not to be seen. Her performance when she cuts the throat of a traitor and immediately goes back to singing a lullaby to her baby was chillingly horrific.<br/><br/>Prabhas disappoints big time, what was he thinking using the same bhimavaram accent and the hairstyle, they should have at least done something about these two. He does appear confused with both the roles, maybe we get to see some performance in the second part.<br/><br/>Rana too dashes hopes, he is not so menacing as the publicity designs make him to be. He is just a sorry mess of Duryodhana and Rameses, the Egyptian pharaoh.<br/><br/>Sathyaraj's character reminds you too much of Bheeshma from Mahabharata, a person who knows his king is wrong, but what the hell, he has sworn allegiance and he is to stand by the king.<br/><br/>Music by Keeravani is forgettable, you don't remember any of the songs except the \"pachhabottu\" song, even that because of Tamannah's strip act.<br/><br/>KK Senthil Kumar's cinematography is a wow, he has managed to capture every single thing the way it was meant to be. The battle scenes were beautifully covered, so was Sivudu's mission impossible mountain hike as well as the palace grandeur.<br/><br/>End of the day, it only looks like SS Rajamouli has bitten more than he can chew this time. But yes he does deserve a pat on the back for even thinking of mounting a movie on such a scale, if only he had concentrated on the story as well, we would have had a epic adventure on our hands.</div>\n",

I could accept it if it was some local regional language production. <br/><br/>I dunno how people can rate this movie so high. Its an actual embarrassment of pilferage of ideas and philosophies from other English movies, executed with utmost crassness.<br/><br/>I have no clue how they got many to gush so much over this truly horrible horrible production. But this a an example is truly a shameful offering from Indian cinema, who do produce several excellent movies.<br/><br/>I think much of the production costs went into marketing and PR to talk up this silly and absolutely horrible movie.<br/><br/>They planning a sequel ... ? Horrors.</div>\n",

The visual effects are for the most part fantastic (some scenes are clearly blue screen). The action sequences are jaw-dropping, and the stunts amazing. (I enjoyed the fact the score wasn't so annoyingly overbearing as in the Hollywood movies).<br/><br/>For a film almost 3 hours long, lit's astonishing that there never is a boring moment. This is intrigue, action and adventure from beginning to end. The final act is nothing short of spectacular, with a sensational 40-minute long battle sequence! The camerawork and visual effects during this particular scene is mind-boggling. This is probably as much of a spectacle today as 'Ben-Hur' or 'Cleopatra' was back in the day.</div>\n",

RamyaKrishna, Sathyaraj, Prabhas and Rana at their best. Eagerly waiting for Part 2. Background score is a plus for the movie. Art department, Cinematography, Stunts are the best technical departments to this film besides Visual Effects. In par with Hollywood style of making with no compromise on the quality. Costliest movie ever made in India. War Sequence, Idol erection are the best scenes to ever watch. Visuals of Waterfall, Kingdom are some of the magnificent brilliance to experience. Perfect movie to experience in Dolby ATMOS sound.</div>\n",

I have created the account today to rate this movie so that I can say to the world that this is our Indian - Hollywood movie. Baahubali is an Indian movie but the standards are equal to Hollywood. I am really surprised by watching Baahubali. I am not rating this movie according to visual effects, actors, music nor even story. I am rating this movie by considering all the things. I am eagerly waiting for the second part now. <br/><br/>Please do not add this movie into South Indian movie list. It is an Indian movie that stands on the top of the list. According to the story line everybody did their job well. I have to appreciate Rajamouli for his daring and dashing guts for doing a project like this one. He has set a new trend by directing this movie.</div>\n",

S.S.Rajamouli congrats to you and your team. There are some minor VFX error like jumping over the buildings etc., which appeared unnatural i hope they are rectified in part-2. I heard someone saying about item song, but it seemed to me like part of plan by the hero and it is apt .<br/><br/>Anushka makeup should have been better, Prabhas and Rana have done justice with their body and action.Not to be forget Ramya Krishna is terrific in her role as Satya Raj in his.The background score is terrific.Resemble 300 and Lord of the rings series, i would say this type of story line will definitely have similarity and which ever comes first will be praised. there are many goose-bumping moments. i enjoyed it through out the time.</div>\n",
